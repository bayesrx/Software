\usage{
Avatar(Counter, cindex, pindex,scales,cutoff)
}
\arguments{
\item{Counter}{Giant Counter Matrix form Data Aggregate}

\item{cindex}{indices in Laplacian for nodes corresponding to Cell Lines}

\item{pindex}{indices in Laplacian for nodes corresponding to Patients}

\item{cutoff}{Cutoff for "Z score"" corresponding to Avatars (set to 1 in paper)}
}
\description{
This function takes giant counter matrix from Aggregate and returns the following: Avatar cell line indices, All Z scores for cell lines, and R scores for every patient cell-line combination; this is a matrix with cell lines on rows and patients on columns
}
